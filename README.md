# Busy Beaver

My first repository, try to translate implementation of 'busy-beaver.c' to Go language

Try step by step, everyday a little...

* busy-beaver.c: 	Source code original from "Computerphyle"
* busybeaver.go:    Source code in Go ;)
* tape.go:          Implementation of a tape for Turing Machine (busybeaver)
* fitxers.pdf: 		Survey of implementations and case studies of Busy Beavers

More information:
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver")

Bonda...

For run: "$go run *.go"

Now splitting in different files for simplification the implementation
